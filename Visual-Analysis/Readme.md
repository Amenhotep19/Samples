##Visual Analysis Samples 

Visual analysis involves the ability to “look” at the current page that is displayed on the device and visually identify either text or graphic images that are displayed.

It acts as a real user, "seeing" real life bugs like corrupted or cut text, something which you might not find when using objects.

Visual analysis is an alternative way of interacting with the device. Its source is the screenshot taken from the device, a 100% match of what the user sees.

Perfecto can analyze the image looking for either text or images, with text being the recommended option. 

**Main uses for visual analysis**<br/>
1.	In cases where object analysis does not work<br/>
2.	When there’s a need to validate what the user sees on a certain page<br/>
3.	In cases where Selenium can't automate system level messages and popups
